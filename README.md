## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

___
My name is Dea Ramanda.

I am a BSI undergraduate majoring in Informatics. Currently, I'm diving deep into the realm of data, with a particular focus on machine learning implementation. I spend a lot of my time working with Python and PHP, using frameworks like CodeIgniter and Laravel.

In my spare time, I work on several personal projects that go beyond programming, involving design and writing. I believe in helping others and strive to be the person I needed when I was younger. I think this is not just good behavior but one of the holiest things we can do for each other.

You can find me on Twitter, [Medium](https://medium.com/@Adnamar), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hid.io/), and soon on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@senzaura1439/streams). Also you can check my portfolio as well [Portfolio](https://shorturl.at/VWw4C) I'm active in several communities on Twitter and Discord, so feel free to say hi whenever you find me.
